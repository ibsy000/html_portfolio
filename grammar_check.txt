I'm like a variety pack of chips. There are so many
                            things I'm into. Like a dodecahedron I've also got 
                            many sides: nerdy, dorky, sporty, outdoorsy, artsy,
                            punny, perky, earthy, trustworthy, adventurous, and 
                            so on. I want to travel and see all the beauty this 
                            world has to offer. I like camping, hiking, canoeing,
                            and playing tennis, softball, football, soccer, frisbee,
                            and basketball. My truck is packed and ready for anything!
                            I like board games, card games, video games, virtual
                            reality, ping pong, billiards, darts, cornhole and so
                            many other fun activities! I nerd out over superheroes,
                            collectibles, comic books, anime, manga, and anything 
                            adorable!
